\subsubsection{What is a random matrix?}
\begin{note}
No definition of random matrix is presented in \cite{bougerol2012products}. In other sources, such as Wikipedia, it is stated that a random matrix is a matrix-valued random variable. I have not seen the general definition of r.v. before (usually the codomain is taken to be $\RR$ or $\RR^n$). So I fill these gaps next.
\end{note}
\begin{definition}
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \PP)$ be a probability space and $(E, \mathcal{E})$ be a measurable space. A \textit{random variable} is a $(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{E})$-measurable map $X : \Omega \to E$.
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
	Speaking generally, clearly we would have $E = \mathcal{M}_{m \times n} (\FF)$, the question is, what is the suitable choice for $\mathcal{E}$? Since we usually consider the codomain of an r.v. to be $\RR^n$ we typically work with the associated Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Is there an analogue here, perhaps generated by a ``natural" topology on the set of matrices? Associated to every norm is a topology. So perhaps we should work with the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the topology induced by the operator norm?
\end{note}

\begin{note}
		A potential alternative definition would be to consider a matrix with random variables as entries, but then this may present some problems when speaking of the ``distribution" of a matrix. A random $m \times n$ matrix can be, maybe, viewed as a map $M : \{1, \ldots, m\} \times \{1, \ldots, n\} \to L_0(\Omega, \mathcal{F},\PP)$ where $L_0$ denotes the set of r.v's on that probability space.
